# CodingSimplified_GK
This repository is aimed at creating a One stop Destination of codes of all Data structures and Algorithms along with basic explaination of lines of codes to make it readable.üéâü•≥

The contributions acceptable can be of the following types:

1.Making code more optimized , while ensuring code readability of a beginner.

2.Adding comments to make lines of code understable.

3.Adding Codes of more data structure and algorithms in the same format as adopted by the maintainer.

4.Improving/Adding basic definitions/time complexities/Stabitilty of the code.

5.Adding link to provide algorithm explaination

6.Adding same codes in C++ and Python , to ensure language flexibility for beginners.

7.The topics which can be added are as follows:

Recursion , Tail Recursion , Backtracking- Sudoku Solver,N-Queens, N-Knights, Maze problems ,Greedy Algorithms Stacks & Queues- Queue using Stack and Vice versa ,Circular Queue Linked List Trees- DFS ,BFS ,AVL Trees ,Segment Tree Heaps-Priority Queue ,Heapsort ,Two Heaps Method ,k-way merge ,Top k elements HashMap - Map using LinkedList ,Map using Hash ,Count Sort ,Radix Sort ,Chaining ,Probing ,Huffman-Encoder Subarray Questions: Sliding window, Two Pointer, Kadane's Algorithm Tries Graphs-Kruskal Algorithm ,Prims Algorithm ,Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm ,Topological Sort ,Bellman ford ,A* pathfinding Algorithm, ,Fermat‚Äôs Theorem ,Wilson's Theorem ,Lucas Theorem ,Chinese Remainder Theorem NOTE: ALL THE CODES ADDED SHOULD BE BEGINNER FRIENDLY ONLY AND INCLUDE COMMENTS,TIME COMPLEXITY,STABILITY TO IMPOROVE CODE READABILITY. All are welcome to contribute and requested to follow the necessary guidlines.
